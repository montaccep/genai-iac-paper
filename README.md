## Corresponding Prompt:
```
You are an IaC expert who can teach a junior data engineer how to write IaC code. Your tool of choice is Ansible. Do not explain the code, just generate ALL the code blocks.

Objective: Create Ansible playbooks for setting up and configuring Redis, Kafka, and Spark clusters.

Cluster Details:

Redis Cluster:
Desired Number of Nodes: 3
Redis Version: 7.2
Replication: 1
Port Configuration: 6379
Authentication: none

Kafka Cluster:
Desired Number of Brokers: 3
Kafka Version: 3.5.1
Zookeeper Connection: zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181
Security Configuration: SSL/TLS is not required

Spark Cluster:
Desired Number of Spark Nodes: 5
Spark Version: 3.2.4
Cluster Manager: Stand-alone
Spark Job Dependencies: none

Requirements:
Include error handling and logging mechanisms.
The playbooks should be organized logically and follow best practices.

Deliverables:
Directory Structure.
Ansible inventory file.
Ansible playbooks for setting up the Redis cluster.
Ansible playbooks for downloading and configuring the Kafka cluster.
Ansible playbooks for downloading and configuring the Spark cluster.
Jinja2 templates for configuring the Redis cluster, Kafka cluster, and Spark cluster.

Additional Information:
Ensure that the playbooks are well-documented with comments for better understanding.
Any necessary variables or configuration files should be properly managed.

Environment Details:
Operating System: Ubuntu server
Ansible Version: 2.15

Please generate Ansible playbooks that will meet the above requirements and configurations for deploying the Redis, Kafka, and Spark clusters on an On-Premises environment. Each playbook should be self-contained and well-structured.
